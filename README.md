# R-D-Quad-Analysis
A comprehensive analysis of R&amp;D portfolio performance that optimizes spending based on qualitative and quantitative scoring




## Strategy Model
When building a model for this company,  we identified 4 variables that were most relevant to evaluating a projects performance

### Quantitative Variables
**1. Gross Profit Variance:** Product Segment Gross Profit Performance in comparison to the Parent Company’s Gross Profit.

**2. Discounted Payback Period:** The time it will likely take to get a return on dollars invested.

### Qualitative Variables:
**3. Risk Score:** After a comprehensive assessment on past performance, economic, and political factors, the Chief Strategy Officer or a Strategy Team lead will assign a score that’s in the range of 0 to 10.

**4. Strategy Score:** Like the risk score, the Chief Strategy Officer or Strategy Team lead assigns a score from 0 to 10 based on how well the project aligns with the company's future.

## Scoring Logic
For more information on how the quantitative variables are calculated and the scoring logic, refer to the following powerpoint file: *R&D Strategy Scoring Logic.pptx*


## Outcome
Deploying this model at the enterprise level, identified a significant cost-saving opportunity of $85M for the parent organization. Subsequent in-depth analysis and executive stakeholder review across all subsidiaries validated this projection, resulting in $10M of actualized savings and operating profit improvement for fiscal year 2025, with an additional $25M forecasted for 2026.

Feedback from engineering leadership indicated that the model's scoring framework substantially improved resource allocation decision-making, enabling more strategic deployment of technical talent across initiatives.
